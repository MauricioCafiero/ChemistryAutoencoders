# ChemistryAutoencoders
Autoencoders, encoders and decoders form the basis of many modern generative ML/AI models. This project is a set of basic 
chemistry autoencoders that can be used as a starting point for building generative or other ML models.

## This project include:
- A SMILES string autoencoder, using GRU layers.
- A 4-channel molecular graph autoencoder using Dense layers.
- A 4-channel molecular graph autoencoder using Convolutional layers.
